* ELFA - Emacs Lisp Financial Analysis
** Description
ELFA aims to provide an easy way to work with Stock market data in both Elisp and Org mode (for use with other languages). It uses Alpha Vantage for its API. The basics will serve as a stock market watchlist ticker to quickly pull the latest prices. However, the goal is to be much more advanced than this, and provide an environment to work with more complex calculations and graphs for financial and data analysts, or hobby investors.
** Usage
As ELFA currently uses Alpha Vantage for its API, you must set your api key (which is available for free upon registration). The recommended way to do this is create a file called ".avkey.el" with the following in it (not a real key, replace with your key):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defvar avkey 'xs35rt65)
#+END_SRC

*Make sure the key is quoted by adding a "'" directly in front of it.*

** Commands
The following commands are available from ELFA.

- M-x elfa-get-stock :: Look for specified stock, display current price in minibuffer.

- M-x elfa-add-to-watchlist :: Add stock symbol to watchlist.

- M-x elfa-add-alert :: Set an alert for a stock price (must be on watchlist).

- M-x elfa-watchlist :: Show watchlist with current stock prices in minibuffer.

- M-x elfa-playground :: Open org buffer with ELFA & watchlist loaded to analyze data.
