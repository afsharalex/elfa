;;; Commentary:

;; Provides an easy way to view and analyze Stock Market, Cryptocurrency, and Forex data within Emacs with both Elisp and using Org. The idea is to achieve similiar workflow to Python with Jupyter notebook and pandas/pandas-datareader/numpy/scipy/matplotlib.

;; Disclaimer: Achieving that workflow means there is a LONG way to go as the python workflow is outstanding, so, for now, this should be viewed as experimental as I have no idea how graphing could be achieved with the flexibility something like dash for python or matplotlib would provide. So, hopefully there are many people in my position who know more than I do about Elisp who are willing to chip in. If you need something that works well, then I suggest using python for now. Cheers!
